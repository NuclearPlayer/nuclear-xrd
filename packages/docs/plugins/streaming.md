# Streaming

## Streaming API for Plugins

The Streaming API resolves playable audio URLs for tracks. When a user plays a track, Nuclear searches for stream candidates (e.g., YouTube videos) and then resolves the actual audio URL just-in-time.

{% hint style="info" %}
Access streaming via `NuclearAPI.Streaming.*` in your plugin's lifecycle hooks.
{% endhint %}

## Core concepts

### Two-phase resolution

Stream resolution happens in two phases:

1. **Candidate discovery** — Search for potential sources (e.g., YouTube videos matching the track)
2. **Stream resolution** — Extract the actual audio URL from the top candidate

### Stream candidates

A candidate represents a potential audio source before the URL is resolved. Key fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` | Unique identifier for this candidate |
| `title` | `string` | Display title (e.g., video title) |
| `durationMs` | `number?` | Duration in milliseconds |
| `thumbnail` | `string?` | Preview image URL |
| `source` | `ProviderRef` | Which streaming provider found this |
| `stream` | `Stream?` | Resolved audio URL (populated after resolution) |
| `lastResolvedAtIso` | `string?` | When the stream was last resolved, so we know when to refresh it |
| `failed` | `boolean` | True if resolution failed permanently |

{% hint style="info" %}
See `StreamCandidate` in `@nuclearplayer/model` for the full type definition.
{% endhint %}

### Streams

A resolved stream contains the actual playable URL. Key fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `url` | `string` | The audio URL |
| `protocol` | `'file' \| 'http' \| 'https' \| 'hls'` | Stream protocol |
| `mimeType` | `string?` | e.g., `'audio/webm'` |
| `bitrateKbps` | `number?` | Audio quality |
| `codec` | `string?` | e.g., `'opus'`, `'aac'` |
| `qualityLabel` | `string?` | e.g., `'320kbps'`, `'FLAC'` |

{% hint style="info" %}
See `Stream` in `@nuclearplayer/model` for the full type definition.
{% endhint %}

### Stream expiry

Audio URLs from services like YouTube typically expire after a period (often as short as a few hours). Nuclear automatically re-resolves expired streams when needed. The expiry window is configurable via the `playback.streamExpiryMs` setting.

## Usage

### Finding candidates

Call `resolveCandidatesForTrack(track)` with a `Track` object containing at least a title and artist. The method returns a result object with `success`, `candidates` (on success), or `error` (on failure).

### Resolving a stream

Once we have a candidate, Nuclear calls `resolveStreamForCandidate(candidate)` to get the actual audio URL. The method returns an updated candidate with the `stream` field populated, or the same candidate if already resolved/failed. This happens when we try to play the track.

## Reference

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `resolveCandidatesForTrack(track)` | Search for stream candidates matching a track. Returns `StreamResolutionResult`. |
| `resolveStreamForCandidate(candidate)` | Resolve the audio URL for a candidate. Returns updated `StreamCandidate` or `undefined`. The candidate is not mutated, a fresh copy is returned. |

### Resolution behavior

| Input state | Output |
|-------------|--------|
| Candidate with `failed: true` | Returns candidate unchanged (no retry) |
| Candidate with valid, non-expired `stream` | Returns candidate unchanged (cached) |
| Candidate with expired or missing `stream` | Attempts resolution, returns updated candidate |
| Resolution succeeds | Returns candidate with `stream` populated |
| Resolution fails after retries | Returns candidate with `failed: true` |
| No streaming provider registered | Returns `undefined` |

## Related settings

These core settings affect stream resolution:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `playback.streamExpiryMs` | How long before a resolved stream is considered expired | 1 hour |
| `playback.streamResolutionRetries` | How many times to retry before marking as failed | 3 |
